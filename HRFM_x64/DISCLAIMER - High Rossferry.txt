Thanks very much for downloading this texture pack!

We have to give credit to Misa for allowing us to use Misa's Realistic Texture Pack (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/69354-64x12512w16a-misas-realistic-texture-pack-updated-25apr2012/) as a basis (currently Misa431). Most of the textures are from this texture pack.

Thanks also to Scuttles' LB Photo Realism texture pack (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/127377-16x-32x-64x-128x-256x12-lb-photo-realism-124-update-3292012/) and JohnSmith's 32x32 texture pack (http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/26727-johnsmith-texture-pack-v93-32x-124-with-customizer-0324/). And also to Jeroanimo's HalfCraft Source texure pack (http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/halfcraft-source-v13-x128-28981/). In the latest editions of this texture pack, some furniture textures of the Urbancraft texture pack are used (http://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/urbancraft---official-ucp-texture-pack-128x128/).

The HD Font is also by Misa.
